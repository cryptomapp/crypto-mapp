# CryptoMapp Solana

This project is a blockchain application built on the Solana platform. It uses Rust for writing the blockchain application or smart contract and TypeScript for the frontend or client-side code.

## Overview

The main purpose of this project is to develop a Solana blockchain application or smart contract. The project is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose:

`app:` Contains the frontend or client-side code for the project.
`migrations:` Contains a deploy.ts file, suggesting that this project may involve database migrations or deployment scripts.
`programs:` Contains the main Rust code for the Solana smart contract. It has its own Cargo.toml and Xargo.toml files, indicating that it is a separate Rust project within the main project.
`target:` Contains build artifacts and dependencies for the Rust code.
`tests:` Likely contains test files for the project.
`types:` Contains TypeScript type definitions for the Solana smart contract.
Other directories like deploy, idl, and release contain various files related to deployment, interface definition, and release artifacts.
